# Hello-World
Hello Everybody, I am trying out my very first depository as a tutorial in the Happy Digital X (HDX) course.
I am a biologist by training and am not very savvy with digital technology but in this time and age I have to be bold to learn new skills to keep up with the digital advances.
I hope to gain new competence through the HDX programme and project work with fellow participants.
